# Lab 3

This is my solutions to exercise lab 3 in the course Artificial Intelligence at SDU on fourth semester of Software Engineering.

### Greedy best first and A\*, from A to the goal

To be submitted

Modify the program from last class to implement the greedy best first and A* search for this graph. Compare the solution paths. Play with the heuristics and see what different heuristic functions would yield as solutions. Play with weighted A* with different weights and compare.

### A\* Vacuum Cleaner

To be submitted

you should be able to use much of the code from the first homework. you will need. To make a few changes though.

1. The state of the search should be represented with three elements: a state, a path, and a cost. Ultimately, cost is defined as the number of moves taken to achieve the goal state from the initial state.
2. while moves and path look the same as before, soulutions (output) are the path, the cost of the solution and the number of explored nodes.

Challenge: Can you generalize it?
